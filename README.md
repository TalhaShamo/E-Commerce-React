Key Features

    Dynamic Product Catalog: Fetches and displays a grid of products from a live REST API, complete with loading and error states.

    Global State Management: Utilizes Redux Toolkit as a single source of truth for the entire application, managing both the product catalog and the shopping cart state.

    Functional Shopping Cart:

        Add items to the cart from the product list.

        View all items in a dedicated cart page.

        Update the quantity of individual items in the cart.

        Remove items from the cart.

    Real-Time UI Updates: The cart item count in the navigation bar updates instantly as items are added or removed, providing immediate user feedback.

    Client-Side Routing: Built as a seamless SPA using React Router, with dynamic routes for viewing individual task details.
